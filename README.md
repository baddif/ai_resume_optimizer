## üèóÔ∏è Background Story
While looking for remote jobs, I used AI a lot to help optimizing my resume.
Then I decided to make a website to easy the use of AI assistanted optimization, also as a way to learn WordPress / PHP / Plugins.
So this is the first project I built with WordPress.

## üß© Architecture Design

  <img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="600"/>
</p>

- **System Modules**: 
  -- WordPress and Nginx for the server.
  -- Using Postfix as my own mail server.
  -- Using React for plugin pages, communicating with PHP backend through RESTful APIs.
  -- Call Hugging Face free API for the AI ability.
- **Design Considerations and Trade-offs**:
  -- Install my own mail server because I cannot register to some free mail service good enough.
  -- Have a lot to improve as this is my first WordPress / PHP project.
- **Known Issues / Improvement Directions**:
  -- The 3 plugins can be merged into 1.
  -- The cache in React Pages is not necessary. This is over design. It involved too much complexity, just for little user experience on the frontend pages... and the experience may not be any difference to end users.
  -- The session management is not very well, need to be improved.
